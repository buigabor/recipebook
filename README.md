# RecipeBook

This project was made with the purpose of practicing Angular. I made a web app, where you can create recipes (name, description, ingredients, imageURL) and store those on the firebase database and fetch them whenever you feel like it. In order to use this app, you need to sign-up and then login. There is also a built-in autologin and autologout function. There is also a shopping list feature, after selecting the recipe you want to use, you can automatically add those ingredients to your shopping list. You can also update and delete those ingredients
