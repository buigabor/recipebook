# RecipeBook

This project was made to practice Angular 10 core concepts and to fully understand the arhitecture behind an Angular application. RecipeBook is a singe-page application, where you can create recipes (name, description, ingredients, imageURL) and can both fetch from and store on a firebase database. In order to use this app, you need to sign-up and then login. There is also a built-in autologin and autologout function. In addtion, a shopping list feature is also availabe, after selecting the recipe you want to use, you can automatically add those ingredients to your shopping list. You can also update and delete those ingredients.
